      <h2>About me</2>
      <h4>I am from Electrical and Electronics engineering background but now looking to start a new 
        career in SysOps for which I am self teaching. so far, the journey has been be very rewarding 
        as I play around with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and incurring charges using their services.
        I am very passionate about cloud computing and have basic
        understanding of CI/CD tools like Git/GitHub, CircleCI, Docker. I am still learning and 
        acquiring deeper knowledge of some AWS services like IAM, EC2, 
        Cloud Formation, S3, Auto scaling, ELB and also increasing my knowledge of C programming language,
        HTML, CSS, Linux OS, bash/shell scripting on daily basis </h4>
